with col1:
    st.subheader("Key Variables Summed Across Counties")
    st.markdown("This plot shows the total Dollar Damage, Acres Burned, and Number of Fires for each county for the entire time period of our dataset.")
    st.markdown("""
    - Reflects the sporadic nature of wildfire impact across counties
    - Some counties have large values for acres burned but little to no economic impact 
    - Same goes for the total number of fires
    - Economic impact largely depends on the location of the fire and nature of the burn
    - Hoping to draw insight from more descrete variables such as weather patterns and fire cause to find trends
    - To highlight a specific example, Nevada county tallied the second highest total damage of all counties in California yet shows a fairly small value for total acres burned within the time frame of our data. In this specific instance two deadly 2017 wildfires did almost 2 billion dollars worth of damage to Nevada county. The fires were relatively small, burning roughly 300 acres of land yet destroyed key structures and commercial buildings. Understanding situations like these are key to understanding the nature of wildfire impact.

    - Can see relevance of fire causes and some environmental factors
    - Number of fires of the size 5000 acres or greater seems to be more relevant than the total number of fires.
    - Although some variables did not show high values of correlation, this is only one type of relationship with others being exponential, temporal and geographic which we will evaluate in further sections.

    - The 99% percentile would be fires with the most damage where as the 10% would be the smaller end
    - Figured relationships may differ at lower or higher ends of the distribution
    - The majority of the values are on the lower end of the percentiles with large jumps existing between the 90th and 95th percentiles. 
    - We can see large jumps in certain variables like ‚ÄúElec. Power‚Äù and ‚ÄúDebris Burning‚Äù meaning that they may be more prevalent in the high-damage events
    - Increase in the building and agricultural values as we move into the higher percentiles. This may indicate that regions that stand more to lose are inherently more vulnerable to large damages
